      "To put it simply, the CTRL mechanical keyboard has it all. Constructed with a solid aluminum frame with a built-in switch plate, it’s stable and fortified. And thanks to the hot-swap switch sockets, it allows you to change switches whenever you want with no soldering required. It’s also fully programmable via QMK, meaning you can assign macros or custom keybinds to every key. With dual USB-C connectors, the CTRL is outfitted with the fastest available connections. Aesthetically, the keyboard is equally impressive. Featuring customizable RGB backlighting and underlighting, it puts on a colorful show; or you can set it to a single color for a more subtle look. The shine-through PBT keycaps only enhance the performance. What’s more, the keyboard comes with your choice of switches, so you can get just the feel you like—whether you prefer something heavy and tactile or lightweight and linear.",

Not the case with the ZJ68. Done in a compact layout, the ZJ68 takes up just over a foot of real estate on your desktop. The CNC-machined aluminum case is slim and low profile, but it’s still thick enough that it won’t slide around. Programmable via QMK firmware, the keyboard connects over mini USB. The drop includes the case, PCB, plate, cable, stabilizers, and rubber feet, but it will require soldering to assemble. Make it your next project with whatever switches you want, or grab a set of Gateron or Cherry MX switches right here. You can even get the keyboard assembled.",
